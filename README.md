# Personal-Expenses-Analysis
1 year personal expenses using generated bank statement (KUDA). EDA with R and visualization with Tableau

Due to confidential reasons I wont be realizing the dataset as alot of personal details are on it.

However, you can interact with the dashboard using this link https://public.tableau.com/views/PersonalExpenseDashboard_16819041859080/PersonalExpense?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

More updates will be done in future if I can generate my other bank's statements in excel then probably compare and join via SQL. Also check out my other project on SQL analysis with generated dataset from WHO.
